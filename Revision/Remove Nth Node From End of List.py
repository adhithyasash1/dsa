Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]

Example 2:

Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []

Example 3:

Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]

class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode(0, head)
        left = dummy
        right = head
        
        while n > 0:
            right = right.next
            n -= 1
        
        while right:
            left = left.next
            right = right.next
            
        # delete
        left.next = left.next.next
        return dummy.next
