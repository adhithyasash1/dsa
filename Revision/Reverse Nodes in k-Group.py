25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group

Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
